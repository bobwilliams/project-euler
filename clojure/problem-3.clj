; 1st attempt...horribly inefficient for large numbers

; (def limit 600851475143)
; (defn factor? [n d] 
;   (if (zero? d)
;     false
;     (zero? (mod n d))))

;   (filter #(factor? n %) (range 1 (+ n 1))))
; (defn prime? [n]
;   (= 2 (count (factors n))))

; (take-last 1 (filter #(prime? %) (range limit)))


; 2nd attempt...much better computationally and I admit I got a few ideas from others
